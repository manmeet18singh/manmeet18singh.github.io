                <p class="about">As long as I can remember, technology has peaked my interest. I have always loved video games and the art, music and
                stories that go along with them. I guess thatâ€™s where my love to be hands on and make things comes from. My interest in
                technology allowed me to choose computer science as a medium for art and creation. I had previously been using programs
                like the Adobe Suite, FL Studio etc. to make different projects and I eventually decided to further develop my skills as
                a creator and choose to study Computer Science. At the recommendations of my family and friends I choose to pursue
                computer science at the University at Buffalo. The major has taught me much and I hope to further develop my skills. I
                look forward to developing my skills even further as a software engineer!</p>
